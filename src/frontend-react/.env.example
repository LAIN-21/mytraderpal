# MyTraderPal Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update with your values

# API Configuration
# Backend API URL (default: localhost for local development)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000

# AWS Cognito Configuration
# These are required for authentication in production
# For local development with DEV_MODE=true, these can be empty
VITE_USER_POOL_ID=
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Note: When running locally with DEV_MODE=true in the backend,
# authentication is bypassed and these Cognito values are optional.
# The frontend will automatically use dev mode headers when Cognito
# is not configured.
